How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    could see each change that was made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    being able to access earlier versions of your program and seeing which versions work and what changes were made

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you can save when you have made significant changes, if you remember to!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git compares commits across the whole process
    google docs arent related to each other, git commits are

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log will show you the commit history, diff will show you the difference between two different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you know you can revert to a previous commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to make amazing web sites!
