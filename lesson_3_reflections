When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?

  When working with people in various locations.
  When working on something from home and work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because Github can act as another backup.
	Because you might be experimenting with versions
	If you have a free account it will be made public
